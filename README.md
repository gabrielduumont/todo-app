# About this project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for the sake of simplicity. CRA is no longer recommended even by react official docs, I would usually follow the bootstrap with nextjs for new applications if nextjs is suitable for the case.
